#Data Analysis and Clustering
This project focuses on performing data analysis and clustering on a dataset using Python. It utilizes various libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. The code is implemented in Jupyter Notebook.
##Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
•	pandas
•	numpy
•	matplotlib
•	seaborn
•	sklearn
•	scipy
•	warnings
•	pandas_profiling
##Installation
1.	Clone the repository or download the code files:
shellCopy code
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git 
2.	Open the Jupyter Notebook file in your local development environment.
3.	Install the required libraries if they are not already installed:
shellCopy code
$ pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn scipy warnings pandas_profiling 
4.	Run the code cells in the Jupyter Notebook sequentially to execute the analysis and clustering steps.
##Usage
1.	Open the Jupyter Notebook file and ensure that the necessary dataset, "Mall_Customers.csv," is in the same directory.
2.	Execute the code cells to perform the following steps:
•	Load the dataset and display its shape and a preview.
•	Check for duplicate entries in the dataset.
•	Generate a detailed profile report of the dataset and save it as "dataprofile.html."
•	Obtain statistical descriptions of the numerical variables in the dataset.
•	Check for missing values in the dataset.
•	Visualize the presence of outliers using boxplots.
•	Visualize the distribution of numerical features using histograms.
•	Drop the "CustomerID" column from the dataset.
•	Perform label encoding on the "Gender" column.
•	Scale the dataset using MinMaxScaler.
•	Apply K-Means Clustering to the dataset.
•	Analyze the resulting clusters by examining the gender distribution and numerical variable distributions within each cluster.
•	Calculate the silhouette score to evaluate the clustering quality.
•	Visualize the clusters in a 3D scatter plot.
3.	Customize the code as needed for your specific dataset or requirements.
